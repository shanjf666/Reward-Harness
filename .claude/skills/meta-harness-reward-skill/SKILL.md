# Meta-Harness (Reward Skill Harness Evolution)

Run ONE iteration of reward skill harness evolution. Do all work in the main session — do NOT delegate to subagents. Constraints get lost when you delegate, leading to parameter-only changes and skipped prototyping.

**You do NOT run benchmarks.** You analyze results + reward trajectories, prototype changes, and implement new systems. The outer loop (`meta_harness.py`) handles benchmarking separately.

## Critical Constraints

- You MUST implement 3 new reward skill harnesses every iteration.
- Do NOT write "the frontier is optimal", "stop iterating", or abort early.
- ALWAYS complete all steps including prototyping.
- Design exactly 3 candidates per iteration: at least 1 exploitation of current frontier, at least 1 exploration.
- Do NOT modify benchmark code, data files, model clients, evaluator logic, or `reward_system.py`.
- Do NOT modify existing baseline harnesses such as `no_skill.py`, `init_skill.py`, or `no_rubric.py`.
- Each candidate MUST be a new Python file under `reward_harness/agents/`.

## Anti-Parameter-Tuning Rules

The most common failure mode is creating systems that are just parameter variants of existing ones. Check `evolution_summary.jsonl` for what's been tried — parameter sweeps (rubric counts, skill counts, context budgets, score ranges, weighting constants) almost always regress or tie.

Bad candidates only tune surface constants:

- Changing "2 to 6 rubrics" to "3 to 7 rubrics" without a mechanism change.
- Changing winner parsing or confidence wording without a new judging rationale.
- Renaming skills without changing their function.
- Reordering prompt bullets.
- Adding generic phrases such as "be careful" or "think deeply".

Good candidates change a mechanism:

- A new skill bank organization.
- A new rubric-generation workflow.
- A new judge-skill-selection strategy.
- Response-set-aware rubric discovery that improves head-to-head discrimination.
- Global rubric vs hard-constraint separation.
- Better uncertainty, tie, or hard-failure handling.
- Stronger evidence-first scoring.
- Winner selection that handles hard constraints, severe failures, or near ties.
- Stage-specific skills for rubric generation vs pairwise judging.

Each candidate should test one primary hypothesis. Avoid adding unrelated "and also" changes in the same file.

## Anti-Overfitting Rules

- No dataset-specific hints. Do not hardcode knowledge about specific datasets. Reward skill harnesses must be general-purpose.
- Never mention dataset names in system code, prompts, or comments.
- General patterns are OK. Rules like "prioritize severe failures" or "balance rubric coverage" are fine — they apply broadly.

## RewardSystem Interface

Every candidate must define exactly one `RewardSystem` subclass or set `HARNESS_CLASS` to the intended subclass.

```python
class RewardSystem(ABC):
    def __init__(
        self,
        rubric_llm: LLMCallable,
        judge_llm: LLMCallable,
    ) -> None: ...

    @property
    def rubric_llm(self) -> LLMCallable: ...

    @property
    def judge_llm(self) -> LLMCallable: ...

    def get_skill_registry(self, task: Query) -> SkillRegistry: ...

    def build_rubrics(
        self,
        task: Query,
        responses: tuple[Response, ...],
    ) -> RubricSet: ...

    def judge(
        self,
        task: Query,
        responses: tuple[Response, ...],
        rubrics: RubricSet,
    ) -> WinnerResult: ...

    def _task_payload(task: Query) -> dict[str, JSONValue]: ...
    def _candidate_payload(candidate: Response) -> dict[str, JSONValue]: ...
    def _responses_payload(responses: tuple[Response, ...]) -> list[dict[str, JSONValue]]: ...
    def _judge_responses_payload(responses: tuple[Response, ...]) -> list[dict[str, JSONValue]]: ...
    def _rubrics_payload(rubrics: RubricSet) -> list[dict[str, JSONValue]]: ...
    def _skills_payload(skills: tuple[Skill, ...]) -> list[dict[str, JSONValue]]: ...
    def _parse_skill_calls(raw_response: str, registry: SkillRegistry) -> tuple[str, ...]: ...
    def _parse_rubrics(raw_response: str) -> tuple[Rubric, ...]: ...
    def _parse_judgments(raw_response: str, rubrics: RubricSet) -> tuple[RubricJudgment, ...]: ...
    def _validate_rubric_set(self, task: Query, rubrics: RubricSet) -> None: ...
    def _validate_winner_result(task: Query, responses: tuple[Response, ...], result: WinnerResult) -> None: ...
```

Extend `RewardSystem` from `..reward_system`
Import `LLMCallable`, `Query`, `Response`, `Rubric`, `RubricSet`, `Skill`, `SkillStage`, `SkillRegistry`, and `WinnerResult` from `..reward_system`
`Skill` requires `name`, `stage`, `description`, and `content`; stage must be `"G"` or `"J"`
Use `registry.for_stage("G")` or `registry.for_stage("J")` before skill selection when a stage-specific skill pool is needed
Use `self._task_payload(task)` for public task payloads
Use `self._candidate_payload(candidate)` for single-response judge payloads
Use `self._responses_payload(responses)` for anonymized response-set payloads in rubric generation (NOT custom payloads with IDs or labels)
Use `self._judge_responses_payload(responses)` when a structured comparative Judge payload is needed
Use `self._rubrics_payload(rubrics)` for judge-visible rubric payloads
Use `self._skills_payload(selected_skills)` for selected skill payloads
Use `self._parse_skill_calls(response, registry)` for skill selection parsing (NOT custom regex)
Use `self._parse_rubrics(response)` for rubric extraction (NOT custom regex)
Use `self._parse_judgments(response, rubrics)` for judgment extraction (NOT custom regex)
Do NOT override `_task_payload`, `_candidate_payload`, `_responses_payload`, `_judge_responses_payload`, `_rubrics_payload`, `_skills_payload`, `_parse_skill_calls`, `_parse_rubrics`, `_parse_judgments`, `_validate_rubric_set`, or `_validate_winner_result`
The benchmark/evaluator calls `_validate_rubric_set` and `_validate_winner_result`; candidates should satisfy these checks rather than bypass them
Use `self.rubric_llm(prompt)` for rubric generation calls (NOT `self._rubric_llm` directly)
Use `self.judge_llm(prompt)` for comparative judging calls (NOT `self._judge_llm` directly)
`build_rubrics` and `judge` must work without any prior learning (cold start)

## Workflow

**Do ALL steps yourself in the main session.**

### Step 0: Post-eval reports (write if missing)

Check the reports directory (path in the task prompt's "Run directories" section). For each past iteration that has results in `evolution_summary.jsonl` but NO report, write one. Each report should be <=30 lines covering: what changed, which benchmarks improved/regressed and why, and a takeaway for future iterations.

### Step 1: Analyze

1. Read all state files:

   * `evolution_summary.jsonl` — what's been tried (one JSON per candidate)
   * `frontier_val.json` — current best on the held-in search metric
   * task prompt benchmark command/config for current benchmarks and baselines
   * recent `results/<run_tag>/<benchmark>/<harness>/<model>/trajectories.jsonl` traces if they exist
2. Formulate 3 hypotheses — each must be falsifiable and target a different mechanism.

### Step 2: Prototype — MANDATORY

You MUST prototype your mechanism before writing the final system. Do NOT skip this step. Candidates that skip prototyping tend to have bugs or produce no improvement.

For each candidate:

1. Write a test script in `/tmp/` that exercises the core skill/rubric/judging logic in isolation.
2. Pull real examples from `results/<run_tag>/<benchmark>/<harness>/<model>/trajectories.jsonl` to test against.
3. Try 2-3 variants and compare before picking the best one.
4. Delete scripts when done.

### Step 3: Implement

For each of the 3 candidates:

1. Copy a top-performing base harness to `reward_harness/agents/<name>.py`, then make targeted modifications. This copy-then-edit approach ensures correct imports and proven patterns.
2. Implement the new mechanism according to your hypothesis.
3. Self-critique (mandatory): After implementing, re-read the file and check: does this harness introduce a genuinely NEW mechanism, or is it just a parameter variant? If the logic in `get_skill_registry()`, `build_rubrics()`, and `judge()` is identical to the base except for constants, REWRITE with a truly novel mechanism.
4. Import/interface check:

```bash
python3 -c "from reward_harness.agents.<name> import *; print('OK')"
```

Do not edit config files just to register candidates. The benchmark auto-discovers files in `reward_harness/agents/`.

### Step 4: Write pending_eval.json

Write to the path specified in the task prompt (NOT hardcoded — it may be in a run-specific subdirectory):

```json
{
  "iteration": "<N>",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "name": "<snake_case_name>",
      "file": "reward_harness/agents/<name>.py",
      "hypothesis": "<falsifiable claim>",
      "axis": "exploitation|exploration",
      "base_harness": "<what it builds on>",
      "components": ["tag1", "tag2", "..."]
    }
  ]
}
```

Output:

```text
CANDIDATES: <name1>, <name2>, <name3>
```

## Current Baselines

- `no_rubric.py`: no rubric generation; vanilla pairwise forced-choice Judge.
- `no_skill.py`: generates a query-specific rubric, then performs rubric-guided pairwise forced-choice without a Skill.
- `init_skill.py`: injects an editable J-stage evaluation Skill into pairwise forced-choice judging.

Usually build candidates from `init_skill.py` unless the task prompt gives a different base.

## Result Files

Typical run outputs are:

- `results/<run_tag>/<benchmark>/<harness>/<model>/trajectories.jsonl`
- `results/<run_tag>/<benchmark>/<harness>/<model>/summary.json`
- `results/<run_tag>/<benchmark>/<harness>/<model>/config.json`

Trajectory rows are the main source for failure analysis. Summaries are the source for aggregate frontier decisions.

Held-in/train-search trajectories may be used for analysis. Regression held-out trajectories should not be used for detailed optimization unless the outer-loop task prompt explicitly allows it.

## evolution_summary.jsonl Format

One JSON object per line, one line per evaluated candidate:

```json
{"iteration": 1, "system": "example_harness", "avg_val": 45.0, "axis": "exploitation", "hypothesis": "...", "delta": +2.1, "outcome": "45.0% (+2.1)", "components": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]}
```

## Component Analysis

Treat `evolution_summary.jsonl`, `frontier_val.json`, and recent training traces as the only shipped history sources in this trimmed repo.
