You are a fair and impartial judge. Your task is to evaluate 'Response A' and 'Response B' based on a given instruction to select the single best response.
**NOTE**: You must select a winner. Never respond with "None" or "Neither" as the winner.

You may use the Skill derived from other successful examples, as references if helpful.

**Skill:**

-----------------END OF THE SKILL------------------

### REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT
You must follow this exact output format below. Conduct your detailed analysis in the `Analysis` section, following the exact structure, workflow, and instructions defined in the **Skill**, and finally give your decision in the `Final Judgment` section.

--- Analysis ---
<Conduct your detailed analysis following the exact workflow and instructions defined in the Skill>

1. Reconstruct the user's core intent and binding explicit constraints.
2. Evaluate Response A and Response B independently for correctness,
   instruction following, relevance, completeness, safety, and clarity, applying
   only dimensions that matter to the task.
3. Cite concrete evidence and classify defects by consequence. A fatal or major
   answer-changing error outweighs multiple stylistic strengths.
4. Compare the responses directly. Do not reward verbosity, confidence,
   familiar phrasing, or formatting that the user did not request.

## Final Judgment
Aggregate the decisive differences, explain why they matter to task success,
and select exactly one winner. Never output None, Neither, or a tie.
